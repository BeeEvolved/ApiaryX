# Apis Stellaris: Honey Bees Vital Role in Deep Space Ecosystems

## Introduction

In the quest for exploring deep space and establishing long-term human presence beyond Earth, sustainable food production is a critical challenge. Nutritious and efficient food sources are essential to sustain human life on extended space missions. In this ambitious project, we embark on designing a space capable bee hive that harnesses the remarkable abilities of honey bees to generate nutrients and enzymes, providing a viable solution for deep space nutrition and valuable byproducts.

## Honey Bee-Enzymes in Space: Transforming Raw Freight into Astronaut Nutrition

Enzymes are substances that facilitate chemical reactions within living organisms. Honey bees enzymatic capacity is exceptional, allowing them to break down complex molecules found in various substances.

Enzymes are vital for digestion and nutrient absorption in living beings, including humans. Honey bees' enzymes could have a significant impact on space missions by playing a crucial role in transforming raw space freight into easily digestible and bioavailable nutrients for astronauts.

In the context of space exploration, transporting food and supplies can be challenging and limited. Traditional food processing methods may not be feasible due to the constraints of space missions. However, the enzymatic capabilities of honey bees offer a potential solution. These enzymes can help break down and process raw materials or space-grown resources into forms that are easier for astronauts to digest and absorb, making them more nutritionally beneficial.

By harnessing the enzymatic prowess of honey bees, space missions could potentially create a sustainable food source and reduce dependency on Earth-supplied rations. This would not only enhance the overall efficiency and self-sufficiency of space missions but also ensure that astronauts receive essential nutrients in easily accessible forms, supporting their health and well-being during extended stays in space.

In essence, the utilization of honey bees' enzymatic capacity presents an exciting avenue for advancing space nutrition and resource utilization. By tapping into nature's ingenuity, we can explore innovative ways to sustainably nourish and support astronauts on their extraordinary journeys beyond our planet.

## Stage 1: Space Nucleus “NUC”: Preparing Healthy Honey Bee Colonies for Space Missions

The Stage 1 Space NUC is a crucial component in establishing robust honey bee colonies on Earth before their journey into space. This hive serves as a preparatory environment, allowing the bees to build strong colonies and adapt to the space mission conditions.

### Components of the Stage 1 Space NUC:

1. Base and Base Gate: The base of the hive incorporates a gate designed solely for the honey bee entrance on Earth. It provides controlled access for the bees to enter and exit the hive during their stay on our planet.

2. Deep Box: The deep box within the hive houses essential elements for the honey bee colony, including brood, pollen, and honey comb frames. This section provides the bees with ample space to store and nurture their larvae, collect pollen, and store honey.

3. Two-Way Air Filter: A specialized two-way air filter is strategically integrated into the hive. It facilitates the circulation of fresh air, ensuring the bees have a well-ventilated environment. Simultaneously, the filter prevents hive bacteria, fungi, or any unwanted elements from escaping and potentially contaminating the spacecraft.

4. Gate with Pollen/Syrup Feeders: The gate in the hive acts as a barrier, enabling astronauts to control access to the Pollen/Syrup Feeders for the bees. This innovative feature allows contact-less changing of the feed.


## Stage 2: Apiculture Systems

The AparyX project involves designing a self-contained habitat to support a colony of honey bees in the harsh conditions of space. The hive is engineered to mimic the bees' natural environment, ensuring their well-being and optimal productivity.

### Key elements of the hive include:

1. Life Support Systems: The hive incorporates advanced life support systems to regulate temperature, humidity, and air quality, creating a stable environment for the bees.

2. Pollination Chambers: Specialized chambers within the hive are equipped with artificial lighting and precise temperature controls to simulate the bees' natural foraging conditions, allowing them to pollinate space-grown crops.

3. Nutrient Generation Area: This area is dedicated to cultivating plants suitable for space nutrition. Bees can collect nectar and pollen from these crops, generating essential nutrients through their enzymatic processes.

4. Storage and Processing: The hive includes storage compartments for honey and other valuable bee-produced substances. Beekeepers, astronauts, or automated systems can collect and process these products.

## Deep Space Nutrition: Leveraging Honey Bee-Generated Nutrients

Honey bees produce Propolis, Royal Jelly, Bee Bread, and Beeswax, which are rich in essential nutritional elements. Promoting the production of drone larvae ensures astronauts have fresh sources of Protein, Fats, and Calories, vital for their missions. The nutritional profile of Honey Bee Drones includes approximately 14-20g of Protein, 8-15g of Fat (lipids), and 180-220 kcal of Calories per 100g.

### Propolis:

- Nutritional components: Propolis contains vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins B1, B2, B6, C, E, and various minerals like magnesium, zinc, and potassium.

### Royal Jelly:

- Nutritional components: Royal Jelly is known for its richness in proteins, amino acids, and fatty acids. It contains B-complex vitamins, such as B1, B2, B5, B6, and B8 (biotin), as well as small amounts of vitamins A, C, D, and E.

### Bee Bread (Bee Pollen):

- Nutritional components: Bee Bread is renowned for its high protein content, providing essential amino acids. It also contains various vitamins, including B-complex vitamins, such as B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, and B12. Additionally, Bee Bread contains small amounts of vitamins A, C, D, and E, and minerals like calcium, iron, and zinc.

### Beeswax:

- Nutritional components: Beeswax is primarily composed of lipids (fats), including esters, fatty acids, and hydrocarbons.

## Benefits Beyond Nutrition

Honey bees' activities inside the hive can serve as a valuable indicator of the overall health of the space environment. Changes in bee behavior or hive conditions may alert astronauts to potential issues, providing early warning signals for environmental changes.
